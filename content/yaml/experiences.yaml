      In my first couple of months at Dots, I managed to quickly accelerate in-flight plans to migrate the CICD pipeline from Jenkins to Github Actions. I was able to bring my previous experiences using the platform to help implement the entire Continuous Integration pipeline while assisting other engineers implement the Continuous Delivery portion. Over the rest of my time at Dots I continued implementing many Quality of Life features and improvements while also ensuring to refactor and utilize new Github Actions features as they were released.

      In the following months, my work primarily consisted of improving and overhauling the internal game and liveop services configuration webapp. Having grown rapidly in the past couple years, the complexity of managing their various game configurations resulted in a difficult-to-use tool for operators. Working with various key stakeholders, I was the primary engineer tasked with implementing an overhauled webapp while also migrating from Vue to Angular.

      My work consisted of creating, managing, and improving the financial compliance systems and business process automations that engineers were subject to as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Work done on this front included building a code and commit flagging algorithm and its infrastructure, creating an internal survey system sent to engineers with certain compliance concerns built in mind along with integrations to the code and commit analysis results, and a slew of custom internal tools for compliance work automation. One area of impact consisted of working on the team's transition to cloud infrastructure as Etsy moved away from self-hosted data centers. This work required quickly learning a completely new class of technology due to my lack of cloud experience and then forming effective solutions for the migration.

      In mid-2019 I unexpectedly inherited and became the sole maintainer of Etsyâ€™s financial auditing business process automations and system infrastructure that processed tens of terabytes of transaction data per day. This period of sole ownership lasted until late 2020 when the team hired new engineers. My work in quickly learning and taking ownership of the complex system earned me recognition with my promotion to a Sr. SWE. My last half-year at the company consisted of training the new engineers to take over before my departure to ensure a smooth transition of system and process ownership. This work was particularly enjoyable as I could ensure the new engineers would have a better experience with ownership transition in contrast to my own.

      A sizable online gaming community created with a group of friends back in high school. The community is primarily centered around recreating the fictional world from the Touhou Project series of Japanese indie games in a fully public and explorable Minecraft server. However over time, the community has grown and expanded to cover a large swath of games, mediums, and sub-communities!

      Technologically, we self-host our game servers while using cloud infrastructure for our network related needs. Other things we do include an internally made modern webpage, CICD automation for our webpage/tools, and many custom tools for various needs like backups, system management, and chat integrations. Much of my contributions these days consist of being the cloud/system administrator and manager of the physical hardware. I may or may not have started building a homelab for fun.

      A Japanese community center in Ridgefield, NJ offering various informational services to new expats and hosting bilingual fitness and Japanese culture classes for the general community. I volunteer my time as the sole "IT guy" by building and maintaining the online infrastructure as well as develop custom tools and webapps. Work includes configuring and maintaining the self-hosted email infrastructure, an infrastructurally isolated Wordpress instance for their primary public facing website, and creating custom solutions when off-the-shelf products don't meet our needs. My primary project for this community is a webapp for patrons to sign up and pre-pay for classes with general user and staff management capabilities. Features include an internal payroll system, basic analytics and data export features, as well as integration with Google Calendars for staff to schedule classes and their metadata such as instructor, room, etc.

      A wiki for a niche Japanese webgame, I was the primary data collector and developer for the purpose of automating various aspects of data mining and writing wikimedia modules. Work included making custom tools for extracting, decoding, and analyzing online data and resources using headless browser environments to handle authentication and anti-botting measures. A significant portion of this work consisted of decoding and documenting obfuscated data and api responses for public sharing. Other work included making a custom IRC chatbot with features such as a live notification system sourced from various news and social media feeds, . Wikimedia modules consisted of easy to use templates and functions for automatically creating html blocks illustrating game mechanics and other complex information. Finally, I also contributed much work in the form of translating game information and news from Japanese to English.
